# Changelog

Notable changes to rcspp. There has been no release yet, so everything below is **Unreleased**.
Each entry says what an existing model or caller sees differently.

## Unreleased

### Behaviour changes

- **No path passes through a source or continues past a sink, in any algorithm.** A path starts
  at a source and ends at a sink, with neither strictly inside it. Before, every algorithm could
  extend a label into a source, and `pulling` and `greedy` (with the tabu and diversification
  searches) could extend one out of a sink. On a graph with several sources, an arc into a source
  or an arc out of a sink, answers can change: in the example in the docs, -6 via `0 1 2` becomes
  -1 via `1 2`. See "What every algorithm returns" in `docs/advanced/algorithms.md`.

### Added

- **`SolveResult.memory_pressure_triggered`** (C++ and Python), and
  `Algorithm::memory_pressure_was_triggered()`: whether memory pressure trimmed the solve, which a
  `complete` status does not rule out.
- **`Algorithm::get_number_of_extended_labels()`**: the labels the last solve extended, a
  machine-independent measure of work.

### Fixed

- `ResourceGraph::solve` restores the arcs its preprocessing removed even when the solve throws.
  Before, any exception out of a solve (a user function's error, say) left those arcs deleted from
  the caller's graph, so a fallback solve priced on a smaller graph.
- Memory pressure no longer loosens a per-node label quota the caller set tighter than
  `memory_pressure_max_labels_per_node`, in any labelling algorithm. It used to replace the quota
  outright, so under pressure a quota of 5 became 200.
